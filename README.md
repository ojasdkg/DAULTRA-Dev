# Project: Circle and Arc Dimension Extraction Tool

## Introduction

This tool processes an image containing geometric shapes (circles and arcs) to extract and calculate their dimensions in millimeters. It annotates the shapes on the image and saves the results to a CSV file for further analysis. This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates image processing using Python and OpenCV.

## Dimension Analysis

A Python package for calculating dimensions of objects in an image using OpenCV.
